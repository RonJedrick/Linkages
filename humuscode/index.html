    <h1> Quick hummus recipe
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
        It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
    
Hummus that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. It deserves it. All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and olive oil in most traditional versions.
